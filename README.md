# Reverse Stable Diffusion
## In this Project we are exploring the might of Stable Diffusion.

<b>Stable Diffusion</b> is an AI text-to-image system that can generate images from textx Prompts. It utilizes a diffusion model, that is a type of neural network that learns how to remove noise from images.

This project on <b>Reverse Stable Diffusion</b> is an AI image-to-text system; that is it generates text from the images that were generated earlier by an AI system. 

In this project we are using a certain Pre-trained model <b>CLIP ( Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)</b> from OpenAI.
 - So its a model trained on large datasets of images and captions;the idea is to associate the images with their captions, allowing it    to generate caption from new images.
